ColorCoder App <br>
CMPS121, Spring 2014

<br>
<b>App Description</b> <br>
ColorCoder allows the user to create colors by messing with RGB sliders.  The app displays a view of the created color, along with four types of color outputs (RGB, HEX, CMYK, and HSV).   The color and values are displayed on a canvas.  If the user likes the color they created, they can save an image of the canvas to the Gallery on their device, which they can keep for future reference or send to any collaborators who may need it.  

<br>
<b>Options Menu</b> <br>
Accessed through the device's menu/app settings button. Contains three options: <br>
- Presets: Various color presets already set by the app.  They give codes for the most common colors.
- Circle Size:  Four different options for the size of the circle that displays the color.  (Used adjust size for different displays)
- Save:  Saves and image of the canvas object to the device's Gallery.

<br>
<b>Known Issues</b>
- On certain displays, the color codes on the canvas show up too large and may overlap. <br>
- Some displays make the sliders hard to move. <br>
- HSV is sometimes not accurate, due to rounding down on values with decimals that are non-zero. 

<br>
<b>Future Development</b>
- Allow the user to set the created color as a preset, so it will be present in the presets menu along with all the other pre-defined colors, rather than only being able to save it as an image in the Gallery. 
- Allow the user to have two colors displayed at the same time, for comparison purposes.  
- Custom menu and buttons, instead of the built-in/default ones.
- The user can input RGB values via an editText rather than only being allowed to use the sliders.  
- Better translation across devices.  
- use the device's camera to grab colors from computer screen, so the user can see exactly what color they want to edit.
